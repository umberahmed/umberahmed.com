        <h5>July 30. Navigation Bars</h5>
        <p>
          Yesterday, I practiced creating navigation bars. In the html file, I
          wrote out the navigation items in the form of a list:
       </p>
       <p>
         <ul>
           <li>About Our Farm</li>
           <li>Buy Chickens</li>
           <li>Chicken Feed?</li>
           <li>How We Raise Our Chickens</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
  <!-- TODO: figure out how to write out an <a> tag without it being triggered</a> -->
       <p>
         The navigation bar was a simple bulleted list on the top of the webpage
         at this point. I couldn’t figure out how to get rid of the bullets or
         how to align each list item horizontally. I started to look for other
         tutorials. One suggestion from freecodecamp was to list the "a" tags in
         the HTML instead of creating a list. I researched a bit more and found
         that creating a list was common practice, so I ditched the freecodecamp
         tutorial and used W3 School’s CSS navigation bar concepts.
       </p>
       <p>
         I moved from the html file and into the css file to add all the elements
         that would create the navigation bar. I used the following css elements
         on the list items:<br />
  <!-- TODO: does the br work okay? above.  -->
          <div class="li-csselement">
             <ul>
               <li>display: inline-block; /* bullets disappeared and text aligned
                 horizontally */</li>
               <li>color: grey; /* changed foreground/text color to grey*/</li>
               <li>padding: 0 5px; /* padding of 5px to the right and left of list items*/</li>
               <li>Font-size: 12; /* font-size to 12*/</li>
             </ul>
           </div>
         </p>

      <h5>July 27. My First Blog Post</h5>
      <p>
      What does every blog need? Text. This is my first blog post. For now it will
      consist of simple text, so that I can claim progress.

      I am taking yoga this summer. Today, our instructor talked about
      meeting ourselves wherever we are and to be honest about it.
      She instructed us to think about our poses and to really teach our bodies
      to do the poses correctly versus doing them the fastest for a heart racing workout.
      </p>

      <p>
      The teachings this afternoon got me thinking about my coding practice.
      As much as I would love to be creating the most elaborate websites with
      as much interactivity as possible, I am not there yet. If I am being honest
      with myself, I've finally begun to understand the difference between HTML
      and CSS.

        As I am writing this blog post out, I've just realized that I am writing in
        what is supposed to be the Contact Me page of my personal site...
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I'm honoring the beginnings of my coding experiences and encouraging
        myself onwards towards many more!
