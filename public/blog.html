      <h2>August 14. Rasberry Pi</h2>
      <p>
        In total I have a basic homepage and an ongoing blog page in development.
        I have a Rasberry Pi and I am going to use it as a server to host my
        personal website so that it can be live. I've started to research
        how I will be able to achieve this and I plan to be live by Sunday.

        Coding practice update: I'm focusing on python functions this week.

      <h2>July 30. Navigation Bars</h2>
      <p>
        Yesterday, I practiced creating navigation bars. In the html file, I
        wrote out the navigation items in the form of a list:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>About Our Farm</li>
          <li>Buy Chickens</li>
          <li>Chicken Feed?</li>
          <li>How We Raise Our Chickens</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <!-- TODO: figure out how to write out an <a> tag without it being triggered</a> -->
      <p>
        The navigation bar was a simple bulleted list on the top of the webpage
        at this point. I couldn’t figure out how to get rid of the bullets or
        how to align each list item horizontally. I started to look for other
        tutorials. One suggestion from freecodecamp was to list the "a" tags in
        the HTML instead of creating a list. I researched a bit more and found
        that creating a list was common practice, so I ditched the freecodecamp
        tutorial and used W3 School’s CSS navigation bar concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved from the html file and into the css file to add all the element
        that would create the navigation bar. I used the following css elements
        on the list items:<br />
        <ul>
          <li><code>color: grey; /* changed foreground/text color to grey*/</code></li>
          <li><code>display: inline-block; /* bullets disappeared and text aligned horizontally */</code></li>
          <li><code>font-size: 12; /* font-size to 12*/</code></li>
          <li><code>padding: 0 5px; /* padding of 5px to the right and left of list items*/</code></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="navbar"> <!-- TODO: edit image with more official editor.
        whitespace below image is too large -->
        <img src="/blog/images/navstatic.png" alt="navigation progress so far" width="1000">
      </div>
      <p>
        Above image is of progress up to the elements I’ve written about above.
        The navigation bar is pretty static, it doesn’t scroll and I can’t hover
        over the items or click on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elements I decided to add were:
        <ul>
          <li>hover color</li>
          <li>hover rounded edges</li>
          <li>scroll with page</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with the hover color, I used the list elements to add the
        style of white-background hover color.
      </p>
      <pre>
        nav li: hover {
          Background-color: white;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>An interesting observation here, when I would hover over the items with
        my mouse I could see that the padding I had initially set was displayed
        on only the left side of the list item. I went into the CSS file and
        corrected the padding dimensions so that there was padding on both sides
        of the list items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I noticed that the default hover-highlight was a square around the
        item. I wanted the hover to display nice rounded edges. I achieved this
        by adding a border radius of 4px to the list items in the css file and
        it rounded out the border! Wohoooo!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I was able to position the navbar as fixed to the top of the
        page. If I had a full webpage, a fixed position would allow the navbar
        to stay fixed on top of the page.

      <h2>July 27. My First Blog Post</h2>
      <p>
        What does every blog need? Text. This is my first blog post. For now it
        will consist of simple text, so that I can claim progress.

        I am taking yoga this summer. Today, our instructor talked about
        meeting ourselves wherever we are and to be honest about it.
        She instructed us to think about our poses and to really teach our bodies
        to do the poses correctly versus doing them the fastest for a heart racing workout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teachings this afternoon got me thinking about my coding practice.
        As much as I would love to be creating the most elaborate websites with
        as much interactivity as possible, I am not there yet. If I am being honest
        with myself, I've finally begun to understand the difference between HTML
        and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I am writing this blog post out, I've just realized that I am writing
        in what is supposed to be the Contact Me page of my personal site...
      </p>
      <p>Today, I'm honoring the beginnings of my coding experiences and
        encouraging myself onwards towards many more!
